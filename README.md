## Description

An example of an ecommerce site developed with React.js & Typescript. I almost completely made use of Material UI in the design of the site. I have used firebase for authentication and storage.

## Features

I tried to add the basic actions up to the payment stage to the project. As a guest, the user can add products to his basket and proceed to the payment stage. Users can sign up on the site with their email address and password. They can see their information on the settings page and delete their accounts. Admin can add products to the site and delete products from the site.
